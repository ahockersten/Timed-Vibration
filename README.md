Introduction
============
This is a small Android application with the purpose of teaching the user
a better sense of time.

How it works
============
There are two modes in the application, "Practice mode" and
"Competition mode". In "Practice mode" the application will vibrate at set
time intervals. In "Competition mode", the user is meant to press a button
at regular intervals. The application will respond by telling the user how
long has passed since the last press.

In "Practice mode", the device will vibrate at exact clock intervals, rather
than say "once per minute from when the start button was pressed".

In "Practice mode", if the two vibration intervals coincide, the one with the
highest number of vibrations will be the one dictating what kind of vibration
should happen. If the two have the same number of vibrations, the second
vibration interval's settings will take precedence.

Future improvements/bug fixes
