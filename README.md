Introduction
============
This is a small Android application with the purpose of teaching the user
a better sense of time.

How it works
============
There are two modes in the application, "Practice mode" and
"Competition mode". In "Practice mode" the application will vibrate at set
time intervals. In "Competition mode", the user is meant to press a button
at regular intervals. The application will respond by telling the user how
long has passed since the last press.

Future improvements/bug fixes
=============================

Known bugs
----------
- In "competition mode", press "start counting". Switch away from the app.
  Switch back. Press "stop counting". Crash.

Future improvements
-------------------
- Add an options menu to set vibration time length
- Add a proper icon
- Add a sound that plays when you are close to a set goal in
  "Competition mode"
- Make the UI prettier
- The "tap me" button should be a pretty icon instead of a button
- Does it make sense to save stuff in the bundle as well as in the prefs?
  Probably not, but I need to look into it
