Introduction
============
This is a small Android application with the purpose of teaching the user
a better sense of time.

How it works
============
There are two modes in the application, "Practice mode" and
"Competition mode". In "Practice mode" the application will vibrate at set
time intervals. In "Competition mode", the user is meant to press a button
at regular intervals. The application will respond by telling the user how
long has passed since the last press.

Future improvements/bug fixes
=============================

Bug fixes
---------
- In "Competition mode", two timers happening at the same time will produce
sporadic vibration results. Need to ignore one of them when both are
happening. 

Future improvements
-------------------
- Add a proper icon
- Add a sound that plays when you are close to a set goal in 
"Competition mode"
- Add some kind of history to "Competition mode"
 
 Todo before public release
 -------------------
 - Add license
 - Draw some kind of placeholder icon
